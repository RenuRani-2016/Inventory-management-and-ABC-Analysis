# Inventory-management-and-ABC-Analysis

This project focuses on optimizing inventory control using ABC analysis and key performance metrics. The goal is to identify critical items that drive business value, reduce excess stock, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights

ABC Classification: Segmented products into A, B, and C categories based on their contribution to total inventory value.

A Items â€“ High-value, low-quantity items requiring tight control.

B Items â€“ Moderate-value items with balanced control.

C Items â€“ Low-value, high-quantity items managed with simpler policies.

Inventory Insights: Identified stock trends, turnover rates, and cost implications.

Business Impact: Helps prioritize resources, reduce carrying costs, and improve decision-making in procurement and storage.

Visualization & Reporting: Clear dashboards and analysis for monitoring inventory performance.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

Power BI / Excel 

Data Cleaning & Transformation

KPI Development (Inventory Turnover, Carrying Cost, Stockout Risk,store analysis, warehouse analysis, delivery analysis, product and orders analysis)

ðŸ“ˆ Outcomes

Improved inventory control strategy with actionable insights.

Better demand forecasting and procurement planning.

Enhanced ability to minimize working capital tied up in stock.


ðŸš€ Project Overview

Efficient inventory management is vital for reducing working capital, avoiding stockouts, and improving profitability. In this project:

Products are classified into A, B, and C categories based on their consumption value.

Inventory KPIs such as stock turnover, carrying cost, and stock availability are calculated.

Actionable insights are derived to support procurement and replenishment strategies.

ðŸ”¹ ABC Classification Logic

A Items (High Priority): ~20% of items contribute ~70â€“80% of inventory value.

B Items (Medium Priority): ~30% of items contribute ~15â€“20% of inventory value.

C Items (Low Priority): ~50% of items contribute only ~5â€“10% of inventory value.

This segmentation allows businesses to focus resources on the most valuable items while applying simpler policies to less critical stock.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights & Deliverables

ABC Categorization of all products.

Inventory Turnover Analysis â€“ identifying fast vs. slow-moving items.

Carrying Cost Evaluation â€“ estimating the financial impact of stock holding.

Dashboards & Reports â€“ clear visual representation of inventory performance.
